# AAE 450 Spring 2021 Power & Thermal Code

## Overview

A collection of files used to analyze mass, power, volume, and cost of the Project NextStep Power & Thermals systems.

For the Python code, I strongly suggest using Anaconda & Jupyter Lab. I have included _requirements.txt_ to make sure your environment meets spec.

## Subfolders

### _Batteries_

A single Jupyter notebook calculating the mass of batteries using Monte Carlo simulations. The results can be used anywhere but are specifically tailored to the Habitat.

### _Solar-Panels_

Some Jupyter notebooks to calculate mass, power, & volume for solar panels. Mainly Monte Carlo simulations. The mass and volume calculations can be applied anywhere, however the cost calculations are specific to the Habitat.

### _Trade-Study-Habitat_

A trade study looking at launch schedule, mass, cost, and volume for solar panels vs. nuclear power to power the Habitat.
