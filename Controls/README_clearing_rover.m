% README for Clearing Rover MATLAB Code, @Author Nick Johnson
% The main runner for these four files is power_analysis.m
% this file generates plots that are used to determine final rover
% specifications discussed in the final report.
% The clearing_aug_rate.m file uses agricultural auger data to develop a
% mathematical representation of auger consumption as a function of
% rotational rate.  The rover_speed.m file uses the clearing auger
% consumption rate to compute a clearing-allowable speed (discussed in
% final report).  Finally, the clearing_power.m file uses the auger
% specifications and rover speed to compute power required for clearing.  
% This file may also be used to compute the maximum loading condition,
% which is used as the power required for the system in the final report.
